STEPS
a) I opened my git bash on my device and created a directory named PLPBasicAssignment
        command: mkdir PLPBasicAssignment
b) Logged in to my github and created a reporsitory and i initialized a readme
c) I navigated to my local directory
        command: cd C:/Deskop/PLPBasicAssignment

d) Initialized a git repositort
        command: git init

e) Connected my repository on github with my local repository
        command: git remote add origin https://github.com/NjugunaKelvin/PLPBasicAssignment,git

f) I now created a file on my local PLPBasicAssignment directory
        command: echo "Hello, Git!" > hello.txt

g) I staged the changes
        command: git add hello.txt

h) I commited the changes
        command: git commit -m "Add hello.txt with a greeting"

i) I finally pushed the committed changes to my github repository
        command: git push -u origin master

I FINALLY VERIFIED BY CHECKING THE CHANGES ON GITHUB

THANKS TO PLP
